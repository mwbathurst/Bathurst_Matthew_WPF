How many shots of whiskey does it take to get blackout drunk? I find this to be 
a wacky question as I live a straight edge life style, and always
wondered how much it takes.
We will be working with the concept of .30 Blood Alcohol level as the "blackout" threshold 
as that's what I remember from the lecture I got as a college
Freshman in 2001.
