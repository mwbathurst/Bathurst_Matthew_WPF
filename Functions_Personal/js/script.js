How much should I expect to pay on a date with a woman, based completely on looks and age?
The 3 inputs: Her "Rating" for any numerical scale, my "Rating" for any numerical scale, and how old is she.
This calculation can be attributed to Keith Aragon baseball coach from Fort Collins High School

if she is => 21 Her rating * $15 - your rating * $1.75
else her rating * $10 - your rating * 1.75

var herRating = prompt("Rate your Date, give your date a numerical rating."); // This prompts the user for an input on his/her date, can be any number
var yourRating = prompt("Rate yourself, give yourself a numerical rating."); // This prompts the user for an input on his/her own rating, can be any number
var herAge = prompt("How old is your date?"); // This prompts the user for an input on his/her date's age as this will modify the calculation for potential alcohol consumption
